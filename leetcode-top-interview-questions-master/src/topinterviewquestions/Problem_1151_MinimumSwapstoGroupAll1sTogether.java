/*
Given a binary array data, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1â€™s present in the array together in any place in the array.



Example 1:

Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are 3 ways to group all 1's together:
[1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
[0,1,1,1,0] using 2 swaps.
[0,0,1,1,1] using 1 swap.
The minimum is 1.
Example 2:

Input: data = [0,0,0,1,0]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there is only one 1 in the array, no swaps are needed.
Example 3:

Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: One possible solution that uses 3 swaps is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1].


Constraints:

1 <= data.length <= 105
data[i] is either 0 or 1.

    Overview
Assuming that there are ones 1's in the input array data, we need to find a subarray, or a window, of length ones and put all 1's in it by swapping 0's out. Therefore, among all windows of length ones, to find the minimum number of swaps required, we need to find the maximum number of 1's in the window so that we can make the smallest number of swaps to achieve the goal.

Swapping 0's and 1's

Figure 1. Find a subarray of length ones and swapping 0's with 1's.


Approach 1: Sliding Window with Two Pointers
Algorithm

We will use two pointers left and right to maintain a sliding window of length ones, and while we check every window through the input array data, we would calculate the number of 1's in it as cnt_one and store the largest one as max_one.

While the window is sliding through data, we want to maintain its length as ones. At the same time, we also want to update the number of 1's in the window by adding the new boundary data[right] and deducting the left boundary data[left].

Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: \mathcal{O}(n)O(n), when nn is the length of the array.
Space complexity: \mathcal{O}(1)O(1).
Approach 2: Sliding Window with Deque (Double-ended Queue)
Algorithm

An alternative way to implement the sliding window algorithm is to use Deque (Double-ended Queue). The key idea is to maintain a deque deque with the size of ones by adding new elements to its right end and popping old elements from its left end.

More specifically speaking, after initializing deque, we would start appending elements to its right before its size reaches ones. When there are ones elements in deque, we keep appending new elements to its right, and we would also remove the leftmost element from it so that its size is always ones. Along this process, we can perform counting the number of 1's in this deque which is similar to Approach 1.


Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: \mathcal{O}(n)O(n), when nn is the length of the array. Note that the time complexities of adding the element to deque's right end and popping the element from its left end are both \mathcal{O}(1)O(1).
Space complexity: \mathcal{O}(n)O(n), when nn is the length of the array. This is because we need a Deque of size ones.
