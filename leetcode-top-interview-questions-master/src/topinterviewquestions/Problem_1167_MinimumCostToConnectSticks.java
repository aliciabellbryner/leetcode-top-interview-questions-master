    //Time complexity : O(NlogN), where NN is the length of the input array. Let's break it down:
    //Step 1) Adding NN elements to the priority queue will be )O(NlogN).
    //Step 2) We remove two of the smallest elements and then add one element to the priority queue until we are left with one element.
    // Since each such operation will reduce one element from the priority queue, we will perform N-1Nâˆ’1 such operations.
    // Now, we know that both add and remove operations take O(logN) in priority queue,
    // therefore, complexity of this step will be O(N\log{N})O(NlogN).
    //Space complexity : O(N) since we will store NN elements in our priority queue.
