/*
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).



Example 1:


Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
Example 2:

Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.


Constraints:

1 <= k <= points.length <= 104
-104 < xi, yi < 104

//I. The very naive and simple solution is sorting the all points by their distance to the origin point directly, then get the top k closest points. We can use the sort function and the code is very short.

//Theoretically, the time complexity is O(NlogN), pratically, the real time it takes on leetcode is 104ms.
//
//The advantages of this solution are short, intuitive and easy to implement.
//The disadvatages of this solution are not very efficient and have to know all of the points previously, and it is unable to deal with real-time(online) case, it is an off-line solution.
//
//The short code shows as follows:
